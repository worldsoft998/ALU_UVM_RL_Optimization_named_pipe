Architecture Overview:

- DUT: 8-bit ALU with 9 operations.
- UVM TB: Agent (driver, monitor, sequencer), Env (scoreboard, coverage, ai_bridge), Sequences (random), Tests (base, random).
- RL: Gym env wraps simulator via pipes; PPO trains on coverage maximization.
- Bridge: Pipe-based 2-way (stimulus in, response/coverage out). No DPI-C.
- Parallel: SubprocVecEnv for multi-simulator data collection.
- Comparison: evaluate.py shows steps to 100% coverage for RL vs random.

Changes to UVM: Minimal - added ai_bridge and ai_mode check; rest intact.
